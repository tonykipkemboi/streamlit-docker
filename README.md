- `v1.0`: Version 1.0 of the image.

## Usage

### Pull the Image

To pull the latest version of the image:

```bash
docker pull tonykip/streamlit-app:latest
```

## Run a Streamlit app

To run the default Streamlit app using this Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 tonykip/streamlit-app
```

By default, the container will look for a `streamlit_app.py` file in the working directory.

**Make sure your Streamlit app is named `streamlit_app.py` or modify the command to point to your app file.**

## Customizing the Container

You can set environment variables or customize the container using the following options:

### Environment Variables

- ENV: Set to production or development depending on the environment.
- STREAMLIT_PORT: Port for running Streamlit (default is 8501).

**Example**:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e ENV=production tonykip/streamlit-app
```

### Mounting a Volume

To mount a local directory to the container, use the `-v` option:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 -v $(pwd):/app tonykip/streamlit-app
```

This command mounts the current directory to `/app` in the container, allowing you to develop your app locally while using the Docker container.

### Exposed Ports

- `8501`: Streamlit web server.

## Building the image locally

If you want to build the image locally, clone the repository and run:
